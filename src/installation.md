# Installation

## Enable binder for Linux
Please refer to [Enable binder for Linux](./enable-binder-for-linux.md) for detailed instructions on setting it up.

## Create binder device file for Linux
After the binder configuration of the Linux kernel is complete, a binder device file must be created.
Install **rsbinder-tools** and run to create a binder device.

```
$ cargo install rsbinder-tools
$ sudo rsb_device binder
```

## Run a service manager for Linux
If **rsbinder-tools** is already installed, the **rsb_hub** executable is also installed. Let's run it as follows.
```
$ rsb_hub
```

## Dependecies of **rsbinder**
Add the following configuration to your Cargo.toml file:

```
[dependencies]
rsbinder = "0.2.0"
lazy_static = "1"
async-trait = "0.1"

[build-dependencies]
rsbinder-aidl = "0.2.0"
```

The crates purposes:
- **rsbinder**: This library provides various functionalities for Binder IPC, including communication with the Linux kernel and data serialization/deserialization.
- **lazy_static**: The code generated by the **rsbinder-aidl** compiler depends on the lazy_static crate.
- **async-trait**: The code generated by **rsbinder-aidl** creates both sync and async code. The async code depends on the async-trait crate.
- **rsbinder-aidl**: This is used for AIDL compilation and is invoked in build.rs.
